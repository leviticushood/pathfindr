# pathfindr

Pathfindr is a free, lightweight web application that generates a user-friendly, templated 
layout to simplify group trip planning. Pathfindr will allow its users to create, edit, and share 
detailed travel itineraries for improved group coordination. Its core features will allow exported 
itineraries such as ICS calendar files and PDFs. I chose this project to pursue, because I am an 
avid group traveler and often create itineraries for my family to follow along. The project itself 
will challenge my experience (or lack thereof) by incorporating back-end and front-end design, 
applying my cloud stack development education, and manipulating databases using various 
programming languages.
