    <strong>Pathfind.r</strong> is a free, lightweight web application designed to simplify group trip planning through a user-friendly, templated layout.
        It enables users to create, edit, and share detailed itineraries for improved group coordination, with export options including ICS calendar files and PDFs.
        Inspired by my own experiences organizing family trips, this project challenges me to integrate both front-end and back-end development, apply cloud stack principles,
        and manage databases across multiple programming languages.
